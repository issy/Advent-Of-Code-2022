## Testing

This repo is set up with a test pipeline, so pytest will automatically run tests for each day based on sample input/output

You can run this manually with `python3 -m pytest`

## Developing

Include your solutions in `main.py` in the day directory. Feel free to add extra files if you need to provide abstractions for certain solutions. Calling part 1 from part 2 of a challenge is fine, too.

Run your code with `python3 day_X/main.py`
